# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiments expressed in tweets using machine learning. It leverages a labeled dataset of tweets to build a model that classifies sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. By combining efficient text processing and a robust classification model, this project provides insights into public opinion trends, making it a valuable tool for businesses, researchers, and social media analysts.

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatically handles missing values and prepares data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Combines TF-IDF vectorization with a Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Validation Support**: Accepts external datasets for predicting sentiments on new tweets.
- **Result Export**: Saves predictions in a structured CSV format.

## Applications

- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Evaluate public feedback to improve services or products.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Understand public sentiment about campaigns or events.
- **Crisis Management**: Detect and respond to negative sentiments during emergencies.
- **Market Research**: Track sentiment trends in specific markets or industries.

## How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Training dataset must include:
     - `Tweet`: The text of the tweet.
     - `Sentiment`: Sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
   - Missing values are removed to ensure data quality.

2. **Model Training**:
   - **TF-IDF Vectorization** converts text into numerical features.
   - A **Naive Bayes Classifier** predicts sentiments based on these features.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
   - Metrics such as accuracy and F1-score assess the model's performance.

4. **Validation**:
   - Users can upload new datasets for predictions.
   - Outputs are saved in a CSV file (`predicted_sentiments.csv`).

5. **Output**:
   - Includes original tweets and their predicted sentiments.
